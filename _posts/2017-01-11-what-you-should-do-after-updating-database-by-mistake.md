title: What You Should Do After Updating Database by Mistake?
---

So sorry that I falsely updated the database with the following script:

```
update dbo.country
set country = 'Australia'
 -- where countryID = 'AU'
```

I didn't select the last line, so all the original data under country column is lost and cannot be rollback. I write this blog to record what I've after that:


1. Call DBA, ask for a backup instance
2. Call manager, report the mistake
3. Migrate  the data back from the backup instance to production
4. Write an Email to tell manager all done
